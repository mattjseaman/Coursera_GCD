The summary.csv file generated by this script contains 81 variables.  This dataset summarizes over ten thousand detailed observations in the 
UCI Human Activity study.  The first two variables classify the remainder of the quantitative data summarized on each line.

#1.  Activity
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING
  
#2.  Subject
- An anonymous ID representing a test subject (a person) in the study.
  
#3-81.  Quantitative variables
 
These variables represent the overall mean value for a given activity and subject in the study.  For example, if subject 1 had 10 observations
  of the BodyAcc-mean variable, the given value in the summary dataset represents the mean of those 10 observations.
  
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
